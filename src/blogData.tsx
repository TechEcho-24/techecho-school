      <p class="mb-4">Your portfolio is the single most important tool to demonstrate your skills to potential employers. It showcases not just what you know, but how you apply your knowledge. Whether you're a frontend developer, backend engineer, or full-stack enthusiast, a great portfolio is non-negotiable.</p>

      <p class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Hereâ€™s how to build one that stands out:</p>

      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4">
        <li><strong class="text-2xl">Start with Real Projects:</strong> Your portfolio should include at least 3 strong, diverse projects. These could be a personal blog, a REST API, or a full-fledged e-commerce site. At TechEcho, our projects are designed to be portfolio-worthy by default.</li>
        <li><strong class="text-2xl">Document Your Work:</strong> Donâ€™t just share the code. Explain what problem the project solves, the tech stack you used, and the challenges you faced. A good README or case study boosts credibility.</li>
        <li><strong class="text-2xl">Make it Interactive:</strong> A live preview or demo link is always better than screenshots. Employers want to see the product in action.</li>
        <li><strong class="text-2xl">Keep it Clean & Responsive:</strong> Your portfolio itself should be an example of your UI/UX and responsive design skills.</li>
        <li><strong class="text-2xl">Add a Personal Touch:</strong> Share your story. Talk about your learning journey, what excites you in tech, and what youâ€™re looking for. This makes your portfolio more memorable.</li>
      </ol>
